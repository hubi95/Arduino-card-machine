# Arduino-card-machine
The idea for the project was born while playing cards with friends. I found that it would be nice to have a card serving machine.
I had on hand Arduino from another project (open source quadrocopter) and other necessary elements like lego and servos from flying models. All I was missing was the code.
I found online tutorials on how to program Arduino and after few days of building and experimenting I managed to get the machine working.
The machine was able to deal cards to several players, draw cards and sort the whole deck randomly.
This was my first code I wrote in C!
